This will be a living document of programming blogs I enjoy reading or get a lot of value out of. Each one should have a list of the topics they generally cover, and a short blurb about why I enjoy them.

## [Josh w Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)

### Topics

- CSS
- JavaScript
- General webdev

### Why you should read

So many reasons, not least of which is that when I went to his blog to grab the link and paste it here, I discovered a new rainbow image on his home page. Then I noticed the parts of the rainbow followed my mouse around, and as I wiggled the rainbow around like a snake charmer I noticed a settings icon, which opened a slickly animated modal which allows me to change various properties of the rainbow for **all users of the site** (I checked on another device). This kind of thing happens a lot when reading Josh's work, it's clear he realy enjoys what he does and puts a lot of time/thought into it. Plus, his stuff is always nice and performant/usually pretty understated, not just flashy for the sake of it. Overall just writes quality stuff, and I often come back to his articles as a reference when I can use something in them for work.

## [Infrequently Noted](https://infrequently.org/)

### Topics

- React bashing
- Javascript
- Web platform

### Why you should read

If you also feel like there are too many frameworks/abstractions over what's a pretty decent web platform these days. Alex brings receipts for the negative impacts of libraries like React and offers actual solutions/alternatives, as well as examples of using those alternatives in real production sites. He also writes about the web platform and programming work other than writing code.
