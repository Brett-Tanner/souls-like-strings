- I jumped over a railing right after being given access to the open world, found a collectible and kept finding them/interesting stuff
- Collectibles other than currency come with little tidbits about the (interesting) world
- Had a lot of fun for ~2 hours at the start just exploring and finding interesting stuff, didn't talk to anyone but my lil blue pal and some person who called me. Completely ignored the 'detective game' parts (and still found some stuff)
