Charming cultists conspire, cockily causing calamities.

## Why

- You like cool collectibles, world building and the feeling of an answer slowly revealing itself
- Stylish cult in a pocket dimension trying to revive dead gods vibes
- Strong characters, both lovable & hateable

## Why not

- You only like games which require a lot of action, or mechanical skill
- You want a mystery which requires strong deductive skills to solve

## Impressions

If you like collectible hunting, you'll love this game. Right after being given unrestricted access to the world I inadvertently jumped over a railing instead of heading for the crime scene, then spent the next ~3 hours just exploring the island. No matter where you explore you'll find something to incentivise you having done so, even if it's 'just' some currency. My favourites were the varieties of collectibles which divulged little snippets of lore, filling in the background of this strange, fall damage-less island you find yourself on.

Speaking of the island, it almost counts as a character itself. Obviously the graphics aren't aiming for realism, but the PS2-era fidelity mixed with excellent lighting creates a beautiful environment because of that, not in spite of it. Collectibles and clues won't be the only drivers of exploration; there are plenty of impressive vistas which serve as their own reward. The placement and design of different districts help tell the story of its inhabitants and the roles they fill in this little pocket reality. If you think your life sucks, you can at least be glad you're not a citizen abducted to do the bidding of the Council.

It's the Council who are the impetus for your unexpected freedom from eternal exile; they've all been murdered in a locked room despite 4 'Holy Seals' protecting them. With the old power structure thrown into disarray and every remaining cult member a suspect, the island's embodiment of justice has released you to take up your old mantle as the 'Investigation Freak' and crack the case. Exploration is key here too; while talking to the island's inhabitants might turn up some leads you'll need to get off the beaten track to really start unraveling the web of conspiracy.

That's not to say you should avoid talking to your fellow cultists though, their stylish designs and well-written dialogue will keep you coming back even without leads to chase down. Even the overtly hostile characters are fun to interact with, and the others are charming enough to make you gloss over the fact everyone is part of a murderous cult trying to reinstate the rule of decidedly non-benevolent gods over Earth.

## Conclusion

Since this was my first 'detective' game I'm not sure how it compares to others in the genre; the answers were basically handed to me once I found certain key pieces of evidence, no deduction required. But the journey to get there gave plenty of opportunities to theorize, build up relationships and have expectations vindicated/betrayed. Whatever genre this game fits into it's an excellent example of it, and I'd highly recommend giving it a go.

## Tips (Spoiler-free)

Despite all the exploring I did, I still managed to miss at least one pretty major mechanic the game offers until just before finishing it. To help others avoid the same mistake, here are some generalized tips to help you get the most out of your experience:

- You'll get plenty of blood crystals. If you have an opportunity to spend them, I highly recommend you do so.
  - But disregard this for a particular opportunity to purchase near-infinite cosmetics, at least until you're flush with cash
- Try to avoid fast travelling. Randomly getting sidetracked on your way between two places will lead to a lot of discoveries.
- Getting closer to people is valuable, even if it's "closer"
