- seeing another living human in the first few min was great after everything being dead & decaying in first game
- already a lot more dialogue, can talk to homunculi at respites
- lots of very familiar stuff from last game; enemy types and the +5 hp pickups
  - ah looks like they'll be linked, good in-universe explanation for re-using some concepts

## QoL Stuff

- start off with the ability to set challenge modifiers, which is interesting
- initally not sure if they kept the completed/not map and red dots from last game, hope so
  - they did, but more detailed i.e. actual shape of the room & includes platforms
  - not sure if this tips it too far toward handholding yet
- no damage on contact anymore, which feels sooooo much better
- removed charges from spirits, just CD based now, which incentivises you to actually use them
