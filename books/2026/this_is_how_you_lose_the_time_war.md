Kinda surprised I liked this as much as I did; the prose feels overly flowery, the seemingly omnipotent technology the protagonists have access and its implications are mostly handwaved as irrelevant and there's not much going on plot-wise other than an enemies to lovers romance. Despite all that I really enjoyed the ~2 hours it took to finish; the limited world-building does what it needs to by setting up background intriuge and it's fun zipping around the time stream to see the parallel realities our protagonists twist to the needs of their warring factions. The book neatly sidesteps the issues of writing about time travel by just deciding what would be coolest/most useful to the story at a given point, and in this context it works. I definitely skimmed through some of the more verbose sections but it didn't impact my overall enjoyment much. Give this one a try if the concept sounds interesting.
