[My Husband](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63017297-my-husband) by Maud Ventura.

> The perfect couple

The narrator is just a normal woman who loves her husband. Over the course of a week, endlessly escalating revelations exemplify just how normal and healthy her love for her husband is. I'm hesitant to write about the plot in any detail for fear of spoiling it, not because it's reliant on twists or shock value (both of which are plentiful), but because the journey of perspective you go on as you read is part of the experience. The prose is also excellent, posessing that intangible 'quality' I so often lament the lack of. This book is a journey but a short one, so give it a try. If you're anything like me you'll find it tough to put down after the first few pages.
