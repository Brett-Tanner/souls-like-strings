I like the way this guy writes; even though it's kinda performative it's performative in a genuine way, probably something like how I'd write about a traumatic event in my life. There's not really one thing which makes this book interesting; you can read about the effects of a brain injuries, loving families and certainly straight white guys being idiots/in love with meat in other places, but this one pulls those elements together in a compelling way that made it hard to put down. It's much more uplifting than a non-fiction book about traumatic brain injury has any right to be, and I'm glad Drew ended up being OK with who he became in the end. It's an almost unbelievably good outcome to the point you have to wonder how much of it can be attributed to an unreliable narrator, but it's an interesting and eventually heart-warming read regardless.
