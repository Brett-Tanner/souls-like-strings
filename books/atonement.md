[Atonement](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6867.Atonement) by Ian McEwan.

> Home & Away style drama but compelling characters

When I look back on the plot it seems simple to the point of ridiculousness, but the emotional highs and lows carried me through so well while reading that I didn't notice. I wasn't expecting to get so attached to a bunch of aristocrats and their ward, but Briony, Cecilia and Robbie are all deeply flawed, deeply interesting people trying to do the best they can in the world as they see it.

Unfortunately for Cecilia & Robbie, Briony sees the world as a creative 12 year old with a penchant for drama, so witnessing an odd interaction between the two by the fountain sets the stage for all three of their lives being thrown dramatically off course. With the aid of some timeskips we follow them all to the conclusion of their stories, which come with an absolute unexpected gut punch at the end.

I recommend giving this one a try, it's not too long and you should be able to tell in the first few chapters whether it'll pull you in or not.
