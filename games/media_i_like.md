### [Playing Games in Unfun Ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmsS1jF9_EE) - Razbuten

Razbuten makes a lot of thoughtful videos about gaming, but this one in particular hit home for me. I'm often struck by the same impulse to 100% a game if I really like it, though in my case the only two times I actually did it ([Ender Lilies](/games/reviews/ender_lilies.md) and [Ender Magnolia](/games/reviews/ender_magnolia.md)) were both games where you can mostly 100% them in the normal course of gameplay. Like Razbuten I'm a big fan of FromSoft, but unlike him I'm not masochistic enough to 100% any of the Dark Souls games. Elden Ring maybe since I only have the two non-Ranni-waifu endings left, but getting all the legendary weapons/spells was probably the least fun I had with that game.
