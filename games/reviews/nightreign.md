## Implementation Notes

- 'who should buy' matrix at start

## Impressions

- Very frantic at the start, absolutely no idea what you should be doing if not prepared
- Can see a lot of people taking their time and ending up way underlevelled/not knowing why
- Very interested to see solo difficulty
  - lack of other people means less pressure to play 'optimally'
  - not ruining some else's run if you just explore/try stuff
- Upgrades are not exciting, at least at start
  - Have heard character-specific ones from story are better tho
  - they are, more interesting/stronger
- wall jumping can be finicky, died to rain once because I couldn't get up a wall barely taller than my character
  - was fixed in 1.0.1
- shadow dropping Everdark bosses and just leaving people to find them/the new merchant was very cool

## Reception

- Lack of voice chat a big issue for playing with randoms
  - maybe were trying to keep the concept of typical FS co-op
  - but in this game there's stuff like loot sharing, way more difficult without voice
  - and difficult to coordinate abilities, already tough to see what's happening
  - people have expectations set by other co-op games
  - was a couple orders of magnitude more fun with 3 in voice, even compared to 2, despite facing first boss @lvl 2
- After some time I'm more ambivalent on lack of voice chat, feels more sously and people can be toxic
- Lot of people seemed to straight up not understand what genre of game it is
  - You're not meant to win every run in a roguelike; who beat Meg first go?
  - Souls games are difficult? Not sure how this was a surprise to anyone

## Strategy

- Churches are great if they're on your way, but don't ignore fights to get them
- Trash mobs for levels, first camp gives you level 2 and there's always a grace nearby to level up at
  - lvl 1 -> 2 is the biggest single-level jump in stats
- Get damage type for nightlord
