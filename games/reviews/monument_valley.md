## Impressions

The Monument Valley series is 3 chill, beautifully designed puzzle games about (sometimes) lone wanderer traversing the ruins of an ancient civilization who played fast & loose with geometry. I played the original on one of my first smartphones and loved it, so when I saw the first two 90% off on Steam I jumped at the chance to relive my childhood. Luckily, unlike many things (_cough, Doctor Who_), the reality lives up to my memory. None of the levels are incredibly challenging but they're enough to make you think, and the central gimmick of non-euclidean geometry will often leave you wondering how the hell you got where you are.

There aren't that many levels but you can tell a lot of care and polish was put into each, from the stunning visuals and soundtrack to the way every action you take has a sound effect which fits into it. There's so much creativity here, with the transitions betweens sections of certain levels being some of my favourties. You even get a companion cube of sorts, and a whole storyline to go with it!

I highly recommend picking these up, ideally to play no more than one level a day after work to unwind. Could also be great for kids to completely break their burgeoning understanding of how space works haha.
