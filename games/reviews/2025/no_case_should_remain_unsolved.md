> I've never had so much fun clicking sentences

## Why

- Innovative (at least to me) detective gameplay
- Genuinely interesting mystery, delivered (almost) entirely through transcripts
- Surprisingly intuitive, no tutorial and it's not needed

## Why Not

- You'll spend a lot of time staring at transcripts
- Only one mystery, I could definitely play a whole game of this

## Impressions

I won't spoil the mystery, but essentially you're a traumatized old detective trying to pull together the details of her only unsolved case from the shattered pieces of her memory. There's a bit of dialogue at the start to set this up and occasional short conversations during gameplay, but you'll spend most of your ~2 hours with this game staring at a (large) table, with columns representing people involved with the case.

You start out with two columns, the missing girl's mother and father, then add others by clicking keywords which reveal new questions if new or allow asking existing questions if already revealed. Some questions need certain facts to be unlocked, while others require keys obtained by putting statements in the correct order for the correct character. I might not have given the best explanation of how it works, but trust that it's more intuitive than it probably sounds. The game helps you out by pulsing questions you're able to unlock when they become available (and I suggest taking advantage of that feature so you don't end up trying to look for an unlock in pages of text) and generally using contextual highlighting to great effect in a way which doesn't feel handholdy.

As far as story goes I found it very satisfying, the mystery is genuinely pretty baffling to begin with and I felt a real sense of accomplishment as I started to figure it out. You can go to the end before getting all the statements in order, but I recommend finishing completely to unlock the true ending (by having two keys left over). You can choose which ending you want in this case, and can always reload your save to see the other later.

Overall a short but sweet game, maybe this 'table-detective' mechanic is pretty common but it's my first encounter and I'd happily play a whole game of these puzzles. Well worth the price of entry, especially if you like mysteries.
