Even though I kept dying to groal, having to do the run back each time have me time to cool down and think about what iv could have done better

Got so good at the run back that feeling powerful and smooth doing it on the way back made me feel better after losing
Plus most of the spawns are randomised, so even through you can get in a flow state there are still opportunities to improvise

Albeit I had the wreath and the (much) closer bench
