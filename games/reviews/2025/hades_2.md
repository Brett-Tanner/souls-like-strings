- So hype when Cronos dumped me in Asphodel and it looked exactly like it did in 1
  - And actually fighting cerberus
  - And seeing that there's an actual plan for beating the Titan who controls time
  - And that it involves working with Zagreus.
  - Man I hope there's a secret 3rd route where you play as him in the past. There's no way, but it would be nuts
- Everything is so much more polished
  - literally, all the characters are shiny lol
- Crazy this came out in the same month as Silksong
- Scylla kicked my ass a few times, but I like that Odysseus gave me the hint to go after the drummer first, as he would in-universe
- 8 hours in and I think no runs without some kind of meaningful meta-progression
  - maybe partly cos I have experience with the first, but I feel like I'm almost making too much progress
  - game seems to agree since I saw Eris twice
