> Girlfailure makes friends

## Why

- Focused, intriguing plot
- Small cast of characters you'll get very familiar with
- Visuals and music add a lot to the atmosphere
- Lots of personality jammed into the limited character illustrations

## Why Not

- Essentially 'just' a book with pictures and music
- No choices if that's something you need in a Visual Novel

## Impressions

Our POV character is Asya, a Russian high school girl with many friends who like to play pranks on her and a very strong grip on reality. One day a girl (sometimes) in her class is nice to her and she immediately falls in love (obsession?), as you do in high school. Later the girl goes missing, forcing Asya out of her comfort zone and into interacting with the other two main characters, one of whom has a much longer history with the missing girl. Mysteries of increasing size are discovered and resolved, until Asya finally manages to tell the world she loves it.

ZATO is free, about 5 hours long and will almost certainly make you feel something. Give it a try.
