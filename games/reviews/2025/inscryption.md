> Starting a new game taken literally

## Why

- Just do it
- So much creativity
- More than it seems
- Even if it was only what it seems, would still be a good game

## Why Not

- The idea of battling with card-shaped objects is abhorrent to you

## Impressions

Yeah just go play this one. If it looks even slightly interesting to you from the store page, or honestly even if it doesn't, don't spoil yourself by reading reviews. Trust me bro and go buy it.

If you're not willing to blindly spend ~$20 on the word of an internet stranger congrats on not being a sucker, but you're wrong this time. I picked this up after a long string of not-Slay-the-Spire to disappointing card games, and started it while watching Worlds in the background, so the deck was stacked against it. Despite that I'd actually put it on the same tier as Slay the Spire, even if I'm biased towards StS as my first love.

You wake up in a horror-movie cabin across from some old monster who wants to tell you a story through card battles. You also gain the ability to walk around the cabin, interacting with certain objects escape-room style to give you more tools to work with. The card battling is fairly typical for a rogue-like deckbuilder, albeit a very polished one with a distinctive art-style, and if that was the whole game I'd probably still recommend it.

What makes this a 'just go buy this now' game is what happens after you finally have a successful run and unlock the 'New Game' option you may have noticed missing from the main menu when you started playing. Never has a game taken this button so literally. Do not stop playing this game until you have unlocked and clicked the 'New Game' button. Now, go forth, purchase, and play.
