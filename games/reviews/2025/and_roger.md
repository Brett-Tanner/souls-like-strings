> Florence but sadder

## Why

- Gameplay/story combine to really make you wonder what's going on
- Exactly as long as it needs to be

## Why Not

- You don't like these kinds of narrative-heavy games

## Impressions

and Roger is another game in the style of [Florence](/games/reviews/florence.md), which got me into the genre, though it's definitely a lot darker. I won't spoil too much about the story, but where Florence mostly combined its beautiful art and music to elicit emotional responses, and Roger adds gameplay to the mix in a much bigger way. The story is difficult to piece together on its own, but the gameplay draws you further in by making you feel the same way the protagonist does at any given moment, while adding its own clues to the mystery of what the heck is going on.

Overall it's a much sadder story than Florence, which wasn't exactly all sunshine & rainbows all the time, and deals with more serious subject matter. Not to say it's worse in any way, just a very different vibe overall. Well worth a playthrough to experience for yourself.
