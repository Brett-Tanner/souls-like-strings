> A Major swanSong

## Why

- Feels like an alternate version of the main game
- Major Song is a badass in her own, completely different way
- Arguably more complex & difficult than the base game

## Why Not

- Lacks the strong story which made the main game so special
- Set in a factory, so no stunningly detailed backgrounds to admire

## Impressions

I was fortunate enough to play [Sanabi](/games/reviews/2026/sanabi.md) after the DLC released, so I got to go straight from getting my ass kicked by Major Song to kicking ass as her. It's pretty shocking how differently she plays to the General, making me wonder if this is a modified version of their original vision for the main game's gameplay. If so I definitely would have enjoyed that game, though in this it does suffer some disadvantages borne of being DLC.

The first of those is the story, which essentially boils down to the pretty typical 'soldier on a mission' plot I expected from the first hours of the main game. It's serviceable, but definitely a step down from the emotional plot of the main game. Some familiar faces make appearances which is cool, but the plot doesn't have too much to offer as a standalone story. The second is the absence of the ludicrously detailed pixel-art backgrounds of the base game, since the DLC is set entirely within a factory. It's a pity to not get more eye candy but it doesn't detract from the gameplay, and that's where the DLC shines.

Major Song does not have the Claw Arm, but she does have a sword and the ability to set it on fire. She also as a shotgun you can charge by hitting enemies for a power shot, the ability to deflect bullets (empowering herself as she does), double jump and pogo with such ease that it almost cures my Bilewater PTSD from [Silksong](/games/reviews/2025/silksong.md). These abilities are gradually introduced with the same excellent pacing as the base game, and you'll definitely need all of them by the end as you face down swarms of enemies with different attack ranges and patterns.

Overall a great DLC, offering a few more hours of frantic action with the same vibe but completely different mechanics. Also it's free, so why are you even reading this? Just give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
