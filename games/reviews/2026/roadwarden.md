> Maybe I wouldn't like DnD after all

## Why

- A lot of effort went into making a believable world
- Compelling characters with personality and their own stories
- Simple but effective art style

## Why Not

- Swamps of dialogue with nothing to break it up
- No real sense of progress after 3 hours
- Trusts the player a bit too much

## Impressions

I feel bad for dropping what's clearly a quality game so early, but three hours into what's meant to be a ~12 hour experience I need to feel more invested than I do here. I'm leaving a positive review because the game does what it says on the tin exceptionally well; it offers a true role-playing experience in a fleshed out world with believable and (seemingly at least) complex characters.

Unfortunately my brain-rotted millennial attention span prevents me enjoying anything where 95% of the gameplay is reading reams of backstory and world-building, with sparse adventure game style combat encounters. I definitely get the impression this is a well made game its target audience would love and can see what gives it its Overwhelmingly Positive rating, but sadly I'm not part of that target audience. Have a good think about whether you might find yourself in the same position before glancing at the reviews and picking it up, or don't. It's a well made game and there're worse things you could 'waste' a few dollars on than supporting indie devs who make good stuff.
