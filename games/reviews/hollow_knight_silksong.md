Since I'm doing something unusual by playing a game on release, I decided to compound the bizarreness and use a journal-like format for this review.

I've grouped my thoughts by area, in the order I encountered them, which might not necessarily be the order you encounter them in. If you need to get pastan area you haven't seen without spoilers to see one you have, clicking the table of contents on the right should jump you to the area you want without revealing anything above it. It might reveal stuff below it depending on screen-size/paragraph-length though, so probably don't do that on second thoughts.

I'll start each section off with some vague, spoiler-free tips I would've found helpful for getting through the area to minimize the risk of spoilers, then dive into my impressions.

## Overall Impressions

I'm 5 hours in as a start writing this and absolutely loving it, so if you're on the fence about getting the game I can wholeheartedly say go for it! It's definitely harder earlier than Hollow Knight, but you have more tools to start with and get even more fairly quickly.

Animations are so slick, there's something for absolutely everything. You glide back a bit before changing directions, jumping immediately after a ledge grab lets you immediately jump again while doing a bunch of backflips, Hornet flips away from the enemy after pogo-ing... the list goes on. You can tell just from this that they really took their time making everything perfect.

Time to set off on my pilgrimage!

## Bone Bottom

### Hints

- You already have everything you need to grab something dangling tantalizingly, just apply some creative thinking.
- There's a place which will make you think "if only I had a dash...". Remember you're playing a metroidvania.
  - Don't waste ~10min trying it over and over again like me -\_\_-

### Thoughts

We start with an opening cinematic which (I think) is unchanged from the initial reveal, before waking up at the bottom of the ravine Hornet's tantrum plunged everyone into. Obviously the first thing to do in any Metroidvania is look for the secret opposite the obvious direction of travel, and I had a mini heart-attack here when I thought Team Cherry spent 7 years forgetting to add this essential feature. Luckily it's just a little higher up than you might expect, so no need to uninstall the game immediately.

The run up to the first boss is a pleasant introduction to the mechanics; I was pleasantly surprised to learn Hornet can swim when I spectacularly failed the first minor platforming section and there's even a tantalizing collectible which will save you some grief later if you can figure out how to grab it. Said boss has a pretty basic moveset as expected, but still some nice variety and forces you to deal with multiple enemies/hazards. In typical metroidvania fashion you're then presented with not one, but possibly two doors you can't open yet in addition to a strangely high ceiling. You'll also meet nice old lady who Hornet immediately prepares to murder.

Luckily she collapses from exhaustion first, and you meet the first of what I'm sure will be many bugs you get incredibly attached to before their horrible deaths. Make sure you come back to visit granny every now and again, she's keen to hear what the young whippersnappers are up to. After that its into town to meet yet more bugs and a soon-to-be-finished sidequest board.

Not sure how I feel about a Hollow Knight having quests so far, on the surface it makes keeping track of what to do much easier but it just... feels weird. Three of the quests so far (out of 5) have just been straight up fetch quests to areas you've already explored for currency or some regular item, which feels especially weird. The second and third at least introduce some exploration challeges/a new enemy type respectively though, so I'll withold judgement until further in. The other two I've done introduced new characters and rewarded me with something meaningful though, so those are fine in my book.

None of those are available for you to worry about yet though, so off you head to the appropriately named Marrow.

### Mysteries

- Old metal door under the church near spikes
- Blocked door in the church to the left
- No roof above on the approach to the town
- Shy bug in room full of bells
- Side-quest board under construction

## The Marrow

### Hints

- Seems like you should always head toward unusual sounds in this game.
- Having the key is not the only way to break someone out of prison.
  - If you're confused, your good friend Minsc and his buddy Boo likely have some ideas
- If you find yourself thinking 'gee whiz, this would be so much easier with a dash'... remember you're playing a metroidvania.
  - Or, use the terrain to limit your opponent's options

### Thoughts

Cornifer's replacement is a tall warrior bug lady who I'm sure will be a hit with... certain parts of the community. She's also very capable of looking after herself judging by the dead bugs always scattered around wherever she sets up shop. From her location you probably want to go left to grab the silk spear/meet a druid who's definitely not brewing a cauldron of THC. That allows you to unlock fast travel/make a new friend through violence, then finish exploring the menacing looking area. Enemy variety starts to pick up a bit here, with some variations on just running straight at you or following a preset path.

Speaking of enemies, I temporarily forgot I wasn't playing a souls game and didn't necessarily need to beat the boss to proceed, leading to me dying probably 50 times to that goddamn skull/club guy. I very quickly found myself wishing I had a dash to make it easier/possible to dodge his moves, but unfortunately never remembered I'd already found a way into the Deep Docks where I might have been unable to unlock said dash. Since I was stuck with just walking, jumping and pogo-ing, I had a really tough time trying to identify if he was jumping or going for a standing attack in time to pogo or just walk under the attack in time.

I ended up getting frustrated enough to watch a video of someone else beating him, which revealed the strat of trapping him in the smaller tunnel to prevent his jumping attack then just using the classic Hollow Knight 'hit then retreat' strat while he tunnelled left & right. I actually tried to beat him 'legitimately' another 20 times or so after seeing this, but eventually gave in to the cheese. The presence of the small corridor inside the boss room does make me wonder though, did Team Cherry anticipate people banging their heads against him without getting dash and leave the corridor as part of the arena to make it reasonably doable? No other mini-boss arena I've run into so far is anything other than an open space, so you have to wonder.

### Mysteries

- The map makes it very clear there's a room in the middle, but looks like I need the mantis-claw equivalent to get there
- The ferry across the lava can be controlled manually, and there are flying enemies half way across
  - I tried luring one into the shaft up into the hidden room and pogo-ing on it, but not enough height
- Totally innocent guy trapped by cruel light hoarder
- Guy who leaves creepy messages on his ground floor and lives(?) at the top of a platform-less vertical shaft
- Big scary skull thing right at the top on the left wall
- What's the black thing that falls out of my cocoon when it breaks and why does it look like me?
  - Am I a void/spider hybrid or something?

## Deep Docks

### Hints

- Study & emulate the native fauna's traversal
- This game has parrying (kinda). You might be surprised by what you can parry.

### Thoughts

Another step up in enemy design, now we have flying enemies that lob stuff at you from range and spear guys with reach on their attacks. Also the fact they're wearing helmets stops you from damaging them by pogo-ing, and actually deflects projectiles which hit them there. Cool little detail. ANother cool little detail is that you can parry the rocks the flying guys throw at you right back at them, or at other enemies. The shield guys are criminally underused here, their attacks are so fun and the have at least 2, maybe 3 of them. Hopefully more of them behind that door at the bottom, the room where you have to fight all the enemies from this area was a lot of fun.

Speaking of fun, the white lady also wielding a needle is a great fight, the first one so far I really enjoyed. She has so many moves but they're all fair and give windows to punish, though you've gotta be quick to not get parried. You can even dodge the counterattack part of the parry if you're quick enough. Her phase two AOE attack she telegraphs beforehand looks really cool and compensates by messing you up if it hits by giving you a free hit when she lands. If you take your time to learn the moveset and stay away from the edges of the platform (most of my deaths) you'll have a great time beating her in a reasonable number of attempts. Also should point out I love the ability to grab your cocoon from most boss rooms and just leave, skull guy guaranteed spawning it right near the entrance but even though that's not the case here it's usually still possible to get it and get out.

I completely missed the forge lady for way too long despite her being just right of the bench, she seems cool and has a nice little relationship with her shovel buddy. Looking forward to unlocking the crafting kit and actually having something to use my overflowing crafting shards on, but I spent all my rosaries and there's so much to save up for...

### Mysteries Uncovered

- The tantalizingly close jump above Bone Bottom is now possible with the dash, and hiding a roof monster that spews acid at you
  - Running past it is a viable tactic to find the secret at the end of the path, but I'll come back to beat it when I have more tools

### Mysteries

- Got one half of... something, where's the other?
- Big door at the bottom left, maybe opened with the completed something?

## Far Fields

### Hints

### Thoughts

I actually thought this Hunter's March until I looked at the overall world map, guess there's still a whole area I haven't explored in the early game. I initially ran straight through the bottom of this area, then up to the top and what's presumably the final bench. Judging by the sheer number of hot air columns near the end I guess I was meant to go up and unlock the ability to fly up on those like Hornet does in the trailer, but I'll get back to that later. Speaking of the final bench, requiring (not cheap!) payment every time you want to access a bench is borderline sadistic. Not a fan of that at all, Pharloom capitalists.

This is where the enemy complexity really starts ramping up, flying guys who slash all around instead of charging in a straight line, ants with ranged, dash and digging attacks and bigger ants with a subset of the last boss' moveset. But most fearsome of all are the little shadow dudes just hanging out under shrubbery trying to live their lives. The don't aggro you at all, just contact damage, but they make platforming annoying enough and provide easy enough silk refills that I've killed more than I'm comfortable with. How people treat these lil' guys is a far more accurate personality test than Myers-Briggs.

### Mysteries

## Hunter's March

## Pale Marsh

- Love that you can get to what seems to be a midgame area early (and unlock a consumable) by completing a side quest
  - So far sidequests either seem to give a meaningful reward of just require something you already have, which is nice
