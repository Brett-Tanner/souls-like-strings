Will do less damage than other characters, but does it more consistently and can set up the whole team for more damage. His passive helps everyone find rarer items, he can quickly/safely apply status effects and the mark from his character skill gives big staggers/bursts of damage.

Also, he's one of the characters whose final rememberance mission is killing the final boss. Just an FYI as it isn't mentioned in the Journal anywhere.

## Build

- has high arcane so bows with status are good
  - same for the relic that gives your starting weapon poison/boosted attack on poison
- extra skill charge is great cos you can use one to maintain mark and keep one in reserve for dodging
  - or mark two enemies at once

## Basic Combat

- heavy attack fires 3 arrows, good for status/damage up close or on big enemies
- damage fall-off is something to worry about, try it out on dummies at roundtable
  - there's also a talisman which increases the distance before damage drop-off kicks in
  - you also want to be fairly close to keep your mark applied at all times
- your high dex & arcane also make you pretty good with stuff like claws or katanas that apply status, so don't ignore them

## Character Skill - Marking

- lets you dash in a direction, giving you iframes for the duration and marking **all** enemies hit
  - if you deal enough damage while the mark is applied, they'll take a burst of damage similar to bleed & mini-stagger
  - hitting an enemy while the mark is still active refreshes its duration while keeping your progress, but marks don't stack
- directional input during dash will make you dash in that direction, even if away from locked-on enemy
- you can dodge away when the dash makes contact to backflip in that direction

## Ultimate Art - Single Shot

- shoots an arrow which can pass through anything (including terrain) and creates a shockwave around the target if it hits
- you can charge it, but the damage doesn't change. Only charge if you need the iframes/to free aim
- anything hit by the shockwave takes the same damage/stagger as being hit by the arrow, so it's great for clearing adds
