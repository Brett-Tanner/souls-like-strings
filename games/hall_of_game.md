## Games

### Dark Souls

The original and arguably the best, nothing comes close to its world design.

### [Hollow Knight: Silksong](/games/silksong_journal.md)

The perfect metroidvania (for me).

## Creators

### [Iron Pineapple](https://www.youtube.com/c/IronPineapple)

Specifically his "Souls-like games you've never heard of" series, but overall he just seems like a chill, reasonable dude with generally good takes and similar tastes to mine. Even when he's reviewing an absolutely terrible game he doesn't just dunk on it, there's always some kind of constructive criticism or highlighting of the stuff they did well where possible.

He doesn't do any typical 'YouTuber' stuff like constant jump cuts/annoying voices/rage bait, he's just a guy who likes games and makes interesting videos about them. He's definitely responsible for double digits of games on my wishlist, all of which I'm pretty excited about. Plus you get an occasional bonus cameo by Vaati outside a lore video.

### [VaatiVidya](https://www.youtube.com/@VaatiVidya)

Without this man I don't think most people would have a clue that FromSoft games even have stories, me included.

### [Second Wind](https://www.patreon.com/cw/SecondWindGroup)

Their neverending stream of gaming podcasts provides the parasocial gaming friends I need to replace my lack of IRL ones.
