- [enzyme](https://github.com/enzymejs/enzyme) is an alternative to [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) which focuses on the React Tree rather than the DOM
- Jest can run individual tests or suites concurrently, and so can [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/features.html#running-tests-concurrently)
- Running DOM-based tests concurrently writes all of them to the same DOM (at least by default)
- This can make it seem like RTL isn't cleaning up the DOM after each test like it should, potentially wasting hours of your time -\_\_-
- [eslint-plugin-jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-jest-dom) can tell you when you should be using RTL's custom matchers
