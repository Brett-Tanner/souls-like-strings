- [Brand New Layouts with CSS Subgrid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/subgrid/) - Josh Comeau

After being reminded subgrid exists & is useful in [October](/dev/twil/25-10-03.md), Josh comes swooping in with a typically high quality article about the possibilities it unlocks. Siblings being aware of each-other's size & layout is a very valuable thing in CSS, as is a layout being able to 'penetrate' containers like cards.

- [Building a Good Download… Button?](https://css-tricks.com/building-good-download-button/) - Eric Bailey

I did not know links had a `download` attribute, and I would indeed have been unsure whether to make a download 'button' an actual `button` or not.

- [Using the Ancient Evils for Debugging](https://htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/2/) - Manuel Strehl
