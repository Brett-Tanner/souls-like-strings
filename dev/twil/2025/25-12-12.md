- Having a two person team is challenging when one of you is out and the other is blocked by PR review
- You can't read Rails' encrypted cookies in a test (at least by default)
  - Since the test cookie object doesn't implement `encrypted`
- Someone once decided to make a 'Link' component which can be a button, link or just plain text
  - but the button can have a `to` attribute
  - the text can have an `onClick` which can navigate, effectively making it back into a link
  - something intended to be an actual `a` tag can become a button because you passed on `onClick` prop
- So in summary sometimes you can DRY things way too much
- Especially when `a`, `button` & `span` are *already native elements*

More functionality you don't need JS for is always nice, the best code is the code you don't write (because browser devs much smarter than you already did).
