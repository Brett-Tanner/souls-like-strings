- Sometimes you just need to `rm -rf` the repo and start over
  - but you shouldn't do this with a fair chunk of work on a branch that doesn't exist on remote
  - and you definitely shouldn't do it twice in the same week
  - to the same branch
- Vite handles styles in dev (at least the ones you import in your components) by adding them as inline `style` tags
  - this can lead to very annoying and confusing CSS issues
  - and if it does, that's probably a hint your CSS isn't very well scoped
  - should probably make a PR to our theme management library introducing layers/a layer, to avoid issues like this in the future
- We originally had a gem which provided a `react_component` helper to mount React components in our views
  - but it's entirely possible to just write your own partial/entrypoint implementing the same idea
- Pinning internal dependencies to a tag is a very good idea
  - leaving the `package.json` entry just pointing at the repo is not
  - because if you make a (breaking) change to the internal dependency, then make an unrelated deploy, guess which version of the dependency CI pulls in

A nice breakdown of the steps and thought that go into making a bug reproducible so it can be fixed, something I skip over to my detriment far too often.
