- Upgrading webpacker (Rails webpack integration) is hell
  - So is migrating from it to Vite
  - So is upgrading it to the actually-maintained React on Rails
  - In general, stuff that integrates React & Rails seems to not be super fun
  - Our internal icons package is not compatible with Vite's interpretation of ESM, and at least one way of fixing that breaks it for everything else
