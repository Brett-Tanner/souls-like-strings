- When a deadline for some piece of work seems unexpectedly lenient, it's worth double checking that deadline
  - Even if your manager has repeatedly said it's a 'soft deadline' and scheduled work around that
- Making a single "Link" component which can be any of the following based on the props passed
  - an `a` tag
  - a React Router link
  - a button
  - or a span
- One of many reasons for that is you get fun interactions like adding an `onClick` to your `a` for analytics, then discovering it's suddenly a `button`


No TWIL next week since I'll be on New Year's holiday!
