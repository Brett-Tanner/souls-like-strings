- Exciting as it is to start a greenfield project, adding to an existing one can avoid a lot of infra setup
- Ruby isn't JS
- For some reason you need to add `body` and a bunch of other properties to a `Net::HTTP::Request` after initialization rather than just passing it to the constructor
  - It'll quite happily take a `body` argument, but presumably just makes it a header
  - Which makes it annoying hard to notice something is wrong unless you inspect the request/call `request.body` and notice it's `nil`
- Slack bots can't send messages unless they're in the channel, but the API will still return `200`

I vaguely knew `:is()` and `:where()` existed, but had no memory of what they did. This is a handy reminder with examples that they're different ways of reducing repetition in your CSS, differing in the level of specificity the provide to their selectors (highest specificity of all selectors for `:is()`, always 0 for `:where()`).
