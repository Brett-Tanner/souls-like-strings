I'm on holiday next week, so no TWIL since the only thing I'll be learning is boss patterns in Silksong.

- JS devs will really pull in an NPM package for one thing in one component
  - Admittedly it was a mildly difficult date format
  - But, if they just passed the formatted date to the string they could've used `Intl`
- Don't assume a valid timestamp to your backend is a valid timestamp to your frontend
  - Especially when the backend timestamp is nullable
- Honeycomb's frontend observability is pretty cool since you can link front/backend traces
  - But the sessions feature they're working on is kinda unusable with sampling
  - Unless you keep all traces there's a good chance the session will be missing giant chunks
  - Maybe could add some session ID as the discriminator to encourage it to keep traces from the same session?
  - Not sure that's how it works/what it's called
