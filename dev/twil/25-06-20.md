- When a service says they redact PII, trust but verify
- The 'check' half of 'guess & check' is very important
- Being able to replicate errors locally really makes all the difference when fixing them
- You can trigger Sentry errors in prod by editing the browser HTML to add a button which throws on click
  - e.g. `<button onclick="throw new Error('test')">Test</button>`
- CI for PRs and trunk should be exactly the same except for deploying, very annoying to merge a PR and have it fail CI
