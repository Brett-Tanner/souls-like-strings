- It's possible for yarn install to 'succeed' and the package files to not be present in `node_modules`
- It's possible for yarn install to 'succeed' and the package files to not be present in `node_modules` but to be present in your yarn cache
- It's possible for yarn install to 'succeed', the package files to not be present in `node_modules` but to be present in your yarn cache and the package files for dependencies of the main package to be present in `node_modules`
- If this happens:
  - looking at your `node_modules/.bin` directory will show a broken symlink from the package name to what should be the entry script
  - `yarn check` will tell you the package is not installed (despite `yarn install`) having claimed to install it a few seconds ago
  - deleting `node_modules` then clearing your yarn cache and reinstalling will not fix the problem
  - if the package in question is Playwright, switching the project to `npm` will immediately fix the problem
- Or ask a senior to look into it, and they'll find a line with 'test' in `.yarnclean`
- Then wonder who thought making it possible for your package manager to delete files from `node_modules` after installing packages was a good idea
- In hindsight, I did notice `.yarnclean` and even opened it. Should have looked into it more since I was scraping the bottom of the idea barrel
- Loading all the data your application will ever need at the start might lead to good UX once it's loaded
  - But if it takes ~10 seconds to load, how many people will stick around to see that UX?
- If there are merge conflicts in your lockfile, just resolve any conflicts in your `pacakage.json` and the next `yarn/npm install` will autoresolve the lockfile conflicts for you
