- Every time I try a major dependency upgrade (React, Node, etc.) it's an absolute lottery whether it'll be a 3 line or 3 day change
  - Thank god for Typescript and (better than before) test coverage though, without them it'd be hopeless
- Caching is amazing until you have to troubleshoot a problem caused by cache
  - If you're going to use a variable as part of a cache key, make sure it can't be undefined
- Yet another NPM social engineering attack made me go through all our dependencies to see if we need them
  - Successfully removed 3, all of which were classic NPM packages
  - `classnames`, which... does string interpolation with a DSL
  - `snake-case`, which... does camel case to snake case
  - `camelcase`, which we already had our own better implementation of
  - I also finally cleared out `react-test-renderer` in favour of unit tests that actually check something useful
  - Would've like to get rid of some others like `compare-versions` which are only used in one place, but not trivial to replicate/vendor

Not something I'll use on a daily basis (or probably ever) at work, but still very interesting to see the most thorough possible answer to the interview question my skip-level asked me when I joined my current company. The amount (and fragility) of engineering which goes into something we all take for granted now is impressive.
