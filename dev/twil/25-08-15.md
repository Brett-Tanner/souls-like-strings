- You can use [radial-gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/radial-gradient) to draw circles on the background
- Reminded myself that setting css variables inline applies them to all child elements
  - Since SCSS seems to transpile its variables to CSS variables, could I overwrite those values for consistency?
  - And to provide a proper fallback, as opposed to a default value
  - Or is that a bad idea cos it'll confuse someone else who needs to debug it in the future?
- Sometimes just requiring the user (if they're a dev) to dump a bunch of JSON into a field is better than inventing your own parsing language, even for 'simple' cases like an array of URLs
  - Though I think my custom parsing was still the way to go at KidsUp, no one was gonna be pasting JSON around other than me haha
- There are a lot of good tech blogs, and I should probably keep a list of the ones I think are really good somewhere
- `height: stretch` gives you similar behaviour to `flex-grow: 1`, and avoids issues with `100%` or `100vh` caused by margin/padding
