- BE VERY CAREFUL WITH FORCE PUSHING
- ABSOLUTELY DO NOT FORCE PUSH WITHOUT CHECKING CHANGES AFTER A LONG AND COMPLEX REBASE ON TRUNK
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT
- make sure you're not setting `this.loading = true` on a class that has another 5 or so api calls coming up
  - especially if it's not an observable property
  - and you want them to run simultaneously
- when you roll out a new feature to prod, don't just spend hours making a performance monitoring dashboard
  - instead you should probably spend that time looking at the error monitoring
  - or do both, monitoring for new errors is not time consuming
  - basically don't assume you caught everything in dev & staging, users do weird stuff and we have observability for a reason
- on an unrelated note, you can't return from a React component before all hooks have been called
  - otherwise you'll get an error on re-render because they ran in a 'different' order
  - it's possible for this to manifest only when the component is accessed directly through a URL
