- Any meeting with more than one product manager will result in 0 decisions and a future meeting with just the product managers
- Creating a global `FormStore` shared by all your components
  - might make sense for some cases like long, complex forms with many different input
  - but makes absolutely no sense for a form with 4 inputs with virtually no validation
  - and having the global form store can lead to fun bugs like the balance entered for the previous account showing up on the next one
- Always check information isn't already available to the frontend before trying to add it to a different endpoint
- Your apartment can randomly stop resolving `gstatic.com`, Google's CDN for JS/images etc.
  - This lets you load Google pages, but not actually interact with them (in some ways)
  - Most significantly, you can't use Google SSO while this is happening
  - Setting your DNS resolver to Cloudflare in system settings resolves this (at least for me)
- You can share bearer tokens between apps by just passing them to the second app to use in requests
  - Which is how XSS works, so duh
  - But never considered you could do it on purpose between related apps
- Sometimes you spend most of a week trying to figure out how to have shared sign-in between web apps from a native app, only to end up at the same conclusion a senior arrived on over a month ago
  - At least I understand how he ended up there and the tradeoffs that lead to that decision now
  - So probably a pretty worthwhile week for me, if not necessarily the company

Might come in handy next time I need to convince someone at work we don't need JS/an NPM package for a feature but can't remember the native way of doing it off the top of my head.

- [npmx](https://npmx.dev)

Is meant to provide a better browsing experience for NPM packages; if nothing else it lets me use NPM in dark mode.
