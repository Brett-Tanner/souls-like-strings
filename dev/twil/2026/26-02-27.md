- Making tickets is important, otherwise you might forget to implement the whole reason a feature exists
- If you're gonna dump a whole bunch of nested JSON into a column, at least separate it out so the validation logic doesn't clutter a mostly unrelated model

It's crazy how many options there are for something I have literally never done (apart from using `counter` to reset numbering once). I guess there are a bunch of people very into styling lists.

- [ASCII Rendering](https://alexharri.com/blog/ascii-rendering) - Alex Harri

Not sure I'll ever use anything from this but dynamically rendering 3D ASCII art that you can interact with is awesome.

- [Optimized video embeds with zero JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/performance-optimized-video-embeds-with-zero-javascript/) - Stefan Bauer

Much more practical (if I ever work on a marketing site): lazy loading embedded video in a `details` element.

- [Constraints and the lost art of optimization](https://denodell.com/blog/constraints-and-the-lost-art-of-optimization) - Den Odell

Worth a read just for the anecdote at the start; no matter how many times I hear stuff like the first Mac fitting a whole OS in 64KB or your phone having hundreds of times the power of the space shuttle computers it blows my mind.
