- Cookies seem like they'd be complicated at first glance
  - then simple again when you do simple stuff with `document.cookie` (if a bit weird how `=` is overwritten)
  - then complicated again when you need to delete a cookie with `path` and/or `domain`
  - the [CookieStore API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cookie_Store_API) will make this a lot easier once it's baseline
  - maybe I should have just left the `js-cookie` dep in
  - but it was only used once, to delete cookies with a certain prefix
  - that's so lazy
- It's possible for `eslint/react-hooks` to light up like a Christmas tree on your project but not actually result in many (obvious) bugs
  - Did lead to me removing an overengineered solution to keeping a message around which didn't even work though

Makes some good points about not all content necessarily being worth money, and how ads being the 'easy' way to make money online enabled enshittification. Having said that I pirate TV shows which are definitely worth money, but IMO unless you're rich you're best off picking one thing you really care about and always paying for that. In my case that's games, because if TV/Youtube/music disappeared I'd shrug and move on, but if games disappeared it's be a pretty huge shift in my life.
