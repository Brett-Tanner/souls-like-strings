- If your Jest tests are hanging indefinitely, it might be a render loop caused by `lazy` and state/observable updates
  - 'maybe' being the operative word, I still don't properly understand why that was happening
  - but the actual behaviour was never broken and removing `lazy` fixed it after hours of wall head-butting, so I'll take it
- Honeycomb does not let you have an SLO covering two separate endpoints, e.g. comparing the successful requests for OTPs to successful uses
  - Seems like a useful feature for... pretty much everything
  - There are a lot of cases where you want compare the generation of something and its use
  - But ended up having to create two separate SLOs, one for the error rate of each endpoint
  - Which isn't really measuring the right thing

Genuinely impressive how badly Apple messed up with Tahoe's design; peak 'we must change or we suck' thinking in action.
