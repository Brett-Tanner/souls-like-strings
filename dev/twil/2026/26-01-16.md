- It's incredible how far you can get in an unfamiliar codebase in an unfamiliar language with find/replace and "go to definition"
  - I'm now officially an iOS/Android engineer :p

I already knew browsers cached a certain number of pages in the history stack; that's why navigating back and forward is always near instant. What I learned this week was:

- It's called [bfcache](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/bfcache)
- It caches a snapshot of the page, including the JS heap(!)
- It's hard to opt out of; you can set headers, manually reload in an event listener or have an `unload` event listener
- At least so far, it seems manually reloading in an `pageshow` can work in dev but not work in prod -__-

Since I recently replaced some of the time-related packages mentioned in this article with native `Date` implementations, I appreciate the problems `Temporal` will solve in about 5 years when it has enough adoption to use.
