- Being on the other side of an interview (albeit a screening interview) is really weird
  - Really drives home how nervous and eager to please you must look when you see someone else going through it
  - Also, since it was just a screening I still don't really know what a PM does...
- Global setup for Playwright seems a bit finicky
  - We tried adding a `page.on` to catch and throw React errors rather than ignoring them
  - While it worked in the test body it didn't do anything in a `beforeEach` or `test` in the setup file
