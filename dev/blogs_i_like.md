## [Josh w Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)

### Topics

- CSS
- JavaScript
- General webdev

### Why?

So many reasons, not least of which is that when I went to his blog to grab the link and paste it here, I discovered a new rainbow image on his home page. Then I noticed the parts of the rainbow followed my mouse around, and as I wiggled the rainbow around like a snake charmer I noticed a settings icon, which opened a slickly animated modal which allows me to change various properties of the rainbow for **all users of the site** (I checked on another device). This kind of thing happens a lot when reading Josh's work, it's clear he realy enjoys what he does and puts a lot of time/thought into it. Plus, his stuff is always nice and performant/usually pretty understated, not just flashy for the sake of it. Overall just writes quality stuff, and I often come back to his articles as a reference when I can use something in them for work.

## [Infrequently Noted](https://infrequently.org/)

### Topics

- React bashing
- Javascript
- Web platform

### Why?

If you also feel like there are too many frameworks/abstractions over what's a pretty decent web platform these days. Alex brings receipts for the negative impacts of libraries like React and offers actual solutions/alternatives, as well as examples of using those alternatives in real production sites. He also writes about the web platform and programming work other than writing code.

## [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/)

### Topics

- ...Frontend

### Why?

They have a range of talented writers who do a great job breaking down the many, many features of CSS with examples. Also Chris Coyier's new home after selling CSS Tricks, so if you also learnt everything you know about grid and flexbox from him you'll feel right at home. They also sell courses but in my experience they're not pushy about it in the blog, just high quality articles on stuff you should be aware of as a frontend dev.

## [Weird Wide Web Hole](https://buttondown.com/weirdwidewebhole)

### Topics

- Internet esoterica

### Why?

Every week they find 4 interesting, usually weird things on the internet and share them with you, plus some poetry. It's very rare that they share anything I'm not at least a little interested by, and many of the things they share are indeed very weird.

## Design Inspiration

### [Henry from Online](https://henry.codes/)

Love the newspaper look, the transitions between pages and the overall vibe. Unfortunately no RSS feed so actually reading it is a lost cause.

### [Chris Kirk Nielsen](https://chriskirknielsen.com/)

His theme toggle and the actual designs of the themes are really cool.

### [Nic Chan](https://www.nicchan.me)

Very cool windows 95/pixel art aesthetic, and the buttons on their windows actually minimize/maximise! I also want to know what they used to make their pixel art icons, almost exactly the look I'm going for.
